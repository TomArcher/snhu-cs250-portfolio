# Sprint Review and Retrospective

This project includes a [Word doc](SprintReviewAndRetrospective.docx) and a [PowerPoint deck](./SprintReviewAndRetrospective.pptx) outlining what I learned throughout the course regarding the following SDLC and Agile competencies:

- Explain the different methodologies and stages involved in the software development life cycle
- Apply the stages of the software development life cycle within an agile development environment
- Evaluate various software development methodologies and tools

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective, not just implementing "cool" features. I start by gathering input from subject-matter experts (SMEs) through conversations, mockups, and examples of how users expect the system to behave. This information becomes the foundation for defining functional and nonfunctional requirements. Creating user stories helps translate these needs into specific, testable features with associated deadlines. Each story describes what the user wants to accomplish, why it matters, and how success is measured. By framing requirements as user stories, I can focus development on delivering real value instead of just writing code that meets a checklist.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

My approach to development follows an iterative mindset. I like to build software in small, incremental steps where each iteration results in a usable version of the product. This allows early feedback and quick adjustments if the requirements or priorities change. The Agile processes I hope to continue using include sprint planning, regular standups, and retrospectives. These promote transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement. Agile keeps the process flexible but disciplined, ensuring that progress is guided by collaboration and user feedback.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member means more than just writing good code. It means communicating openly, respecting deadlines, helping others when they get stuck, and being willing to accept feedback. A strong developer contributes to the team’s overall success by staying dependable, transparent, and supportive. In an Agile environment, that also means participating fully in ceremonies, sharing progress honestly, and focusing on solutions rather than blame when challenges arise.
